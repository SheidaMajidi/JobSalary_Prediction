# Salary Classification Model from Job Descriptions

This repository contains a machine learning project that builds and evaluates a classification model to predict job salary categories based on textual content from job descriptions. The model categorizes salaries into 'high' (above the 75th percentile) or 'low' (below the 75th percentile) using a Naive Bayes classifier.
